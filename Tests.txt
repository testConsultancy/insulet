16. What can be found on page 48 of the Patient Resource Guide? 
How to Create and Use Temp Basal Presets
-----
1. What are some types of insulin delivery devices?
➢ Expected Answer: needles/syringes, insulin pens, insulin pumps

2. What type of insulin do insulin pumps use?
➢ Expected Answer: rapid or short acting insulin

3. How does an insulin pump deliver insulin? 
➢ Expected Answer: A small amount of continuous insulin—called basal insulin is being
delivered. The user will give additional insulin (bolus) for meals and to correct a high
glucose level.

4. What does CGM stand for?
➢ Expected answer: Continuous Glucose Monitoring (Monitor)

5. How often is the glucose level updated with CGM?
➢ Expected Answer: every 5 minutes

6. What is one value of using a CGM system?
➢ Expected answer: no fingersticks, can tell direction the glucose is heading; alerts and
alarm help user know what is happening

7. What does AID stand for?
➢ Expected answer: Automated Insulin Delivery System

▪ What is the name of Insulet’s AID system?
• Omnipod 5

8. What is an insulin to carb ratio?
➢ Expected answer: the number of grams of carbohydrate that one unit of insulin will
cover ie; a carb ratio or IC ratio of 15 states that 1 unit of insulin will ‘cover’ 15 grams of
carbohydrates; if the customer is eating 30 grams of carbs they would need 2 units of
insulin for those carbs consumed

9. What is a correction factor?
➢ Expected answer: The number that will be lowered in glucose value by 1 unit of insulin
ie; Correction factor of 50 lowers the glucose by 50 points

10. How does an automated insulin delivery system differ from an insulin pump?
➢ Expected answer: The AID system uses an algorithm to help control the delivery of
insulin to keep the user as close to target as possible. It uses the values from the CGM to
complete the algorithm. The basal rate is ‘adaptive’ as the amount of basal changes
based on the glucose levels.

11. What are the part of a CGM system?
➢ Expected answers: the sensor (under the skin) the transmitter which sits on top of
sensor and transmits the data; the App or receiver, the inserter

12. What are the importance of the trend arrows in the CGM system?
➢ Expected answer: they tell the user the direction the glucose is heading

13. What is the desired range of glucose according to the American Diabetes Association?
➢ Expected answer: 70-180mg/dL

14. In the AID system what is TDI or Total daily insulin?
➢ Expected answer: the amount of insulin delivered each day including user boluses and
algorithm calculations

15. What is the duration of insulin action?
➢ Expected answer: the amount of time rapid acting insulin lowers glucose after a bolus
is given.

16. What system has two different modes: Automated and Manual? The AID or an insulin
pump?
➢ Expected answer: the AID system.

When and How to Remove a Pod

1. It is important to ensure the customer has supplies to provide insulin using another delivery method

BEFORE removing a Pod. Can you name some examples of supplies a customer might need prior to

removing a Pod?

a. Expected Responses:

i. a new unopened Pod, alcohol wipe and rapid acting U-100 insulin

ii. OR injections through syringes using appropriate long and rapid acting insulin.


2. Why is it so important to ensure the customer receives ongoing insulin delivery?

a. Expected Responses:

i. To avoid hyperglycemia and potential DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis)

 
3. We watched a few videos to learn about when a Pod change might be required. Can you name some

of the scenarios when a customer should change their Pod?

a. Expected Responses:

i. Low or Empty Pod Reservoir – meaning that the Pod’s reservoir is either low on

insulin or completely out of insulin

ii. Pod Expiration – meaning the Pod has been active for 72-hours and has expired. If

for some reason the customer cannot change their Pod right at the 72-hour mark,

that is okay. The Pod will continue to deliver any remaining insulin for an additional

8 hours (or 80 hours). This is true for both the Omnipod DASH and Omnipod System.

iii. Removed from Site – meaning that the Pod has come off the customer’s body, or

the customer has any kind of unplanned removal of the Pod. We will learn more

about how to help customers in these scenarios later in training

 
iv. Hazard Alarm – during a Pod error hazard alarm or occlusion alarm, the PDM will tell

the customer to change the Pod because insulin delivery has stopped.

v. Signs of infection – these include

1. Pain at the Pod site

2. Swelling

3. Redness

4. Discharge (which can look like clear fluid at the insertion site)

5. Heat at the insertion site


What should a customer do if they suspect an infection?

a. Expected Responses:

i. Immediately remove the Pod and apply a new Pod in a different location.

ii. Recommended to contact their healthcare provider.


5. What is the first step a customer must take to begin the process of removing a Pod?

a. Expected Responses:

i. Deactivate if using the PDM/App


6. Please walk me through the steps to take in the Omnipod System PDM to deactivate a Pod?

a. Expected Responses:

i. Wake up the PDM > Confirm ID > Select More Actions > Select Change Pod > Select

Confirm


7. Fantastic! How would we do this in the Omnipod DASH PDM?

a. Expected Responses:

i. Wake and unlock the PDM > Tap on the Pod info Tab > Tap View Pod details > Tap

Change Pod > Tap Deactivate Pod

Moving to Pod Information/PDM/App Numbers

 
8. What does the Lot number of each Pod for each product start with?

a. Expected Responses:

i. Omnipod System L

ii. Omnipod DASH PD or PS

iii. Omnipod 5 PP1K or PH1K


9. In Omnipod 5 you can find the Lot and Sequence number for the past 90 days. Where do you need

to look?

a. Expected Response: Menu > History Detail > Summary

 
10. The serial number is on the back of the Omnipod System and DASH.

It is found in what screen in  the Omnipod DASH and the Omnipod 5 App?a. Expected Response: About Screen


11. The Pod Adhesive is latex free: True or False?

a. Expected Response: Yes…It is acrylic based. There are no corn, wheat or gluten products in

the adhesive

 
12. True or False: While the DASH pod currently has a blue needle cap, all three product Pods will soon

have the clear needle cap?

a. Expected Answer: That is true. The clear needle cap for the DASH is anticipated to start

shipping end of 2022.

 
13. What is the ‘pink slide’ and why is it important?

a. Expected Answers: Needle deployment can be confirmed by looking for the advancement

of the pink slider. When the needle and cannula are inserted, this pink slide moves forward

and catches, causing the blue cannula to stay in place in the skin while the needle retracts.

b. The pink slide is an outside indicator that the needle was deployed.

 
14. What are the steps to silence a Pod alarm…or manually shut it off ?

a. Expected Answer: Peel back the adhesive on the flat end of the Pod. Look for the gold circle

in the middle. Next to that on the right is the alarm shut-off port. Take a paper clip or

thumb tack and push the sharp end into that port, breaking the plastic sheath. This will

stop the Pod from alarming.


15. What is the difference between deactivating a Pod and Discarding a Pod?

a. Expected Answer: Deactivating breaks the connection between the Pod and PDM and stop

insulin delivery in the Pod.

b. Discarding a Pod only breaks the connection between the Pod and PDM. The Pod could

still be delivering insulin.

i. Discarding is done when communication with the Pod and PDM are not

communicating enough to deactivate.

ii. If a customer discards a pod they should be reminded to ‘silence the Pod’ as that

Pod could still be active and it will alarm at the end of 80 hours of life
