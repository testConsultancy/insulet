A serious, long-term condition occurring when there are increased levels of glucose in the body or blood stream 

The elevated levels of glucose in the blood stream is caused by the body's inability to produce enough, or any, insulin. Without insulin, the body is unable to use glucose for fuel. 

Elevated glucose in the blood. Left untreated, high blood glucose can lead to serious health complications. 
----- 
GLUCOSE: 

=> ENERGY 

Carbs [greatest impact]> glucose > energy for body cells 

additional factors [impacting glucose]: 
Too much, or too little, exercise 
Stress 
Some medications 
Growth hormones 
Too much, or too little, insulin 
Fatty meals 
----- 
Insulin -> regulates glucose in the body 
Stomach ->  glucose into blood stream 
Pancreas -> insulin into cells 

=> THEN glucose is entered in the cells to be used as energy 

=> THEN glucose in blood stream returns to normal 

WHEN above process malfunctions => diabetes 
----- 
** DIABETES 1 ** 

Autoimmune system attacks the insulin producing cells of the pancreas 

Insuline -> only treatment [syranges, pen, inhaled, pumps] 
----- 
Gestational diabetes -> diagnosed during pregnancy 
----- 
Blood Glucose (BG) Levels 

In the US, the unit of measure is milligrams/deciliter, or mg/dL. 
In Europe and Canada, millimole per liter, or mmol/L may be used. 
Someone without diabetes will have BG values between 70-140 mg/dL or 3.89 - 7.77 mmol/L  
----- 
Also called simply A1C, this is the average blood glucose levels over a 3-month period. A1C has been the standard to determine control of blood glucose with under 7% being the recommendation by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) for the majority of people with diabetes.  
----- 
Time in Range (TIR) is the way the healthcare community is starting to look at blood glucose control. This reviews the amount of time a person with diabetes is in the target range of 70-180 mg/dL (3.9-10.0 mmol/L) and how often one sees fluctuations above or below that range.  
------ 
Self Monitoring Blood Glucose 
Continuous Glucose Monitor 
-----  
** DIABETES 2 **
----- 
Insulin resistance 
Cells do not respond properly to insulin 
Pancreas produce extra insulin 
Glucose rises as insulin is unable to enter cells 
----- 
Diving deeper: type 1 diabetes 
----- 
Two types of manufactured insulin: 
Basal -> 6 shots a day 
Bolus -> once or twice a day 
----- 
MDI, or Multiple Daily Injections, is a common method of treating Type 1 Diabetes. The individual with diabetes takes a shot of long-acting insulin (basal) in the morning and supplements with additional shots of rapid-acting insulin (bolus) when they eat, or if they need to correct a high blood glucose reading. 
----- 
The insulin pump uses a small cannula, or tube, that is inserted under the skin to allow the delivery of insulin. The cannula, Pod, or infusion set is changed every 2-3 days. 
Pumps require basal insulin and can be programmed to deliver insulin automatically. No shots to deliver insulin at mealtimes!  
----- 
There are two important concepts that a person with Diabetes must consider when counting carbohydrates: carbohydrate ratio and correction factor. 
----- 
U100 -> fast acting insulin [used for the pod 72h obtained from pharmacy] [can't use U200 or others because the delivery is too high] 
-----

optimal glucose control [target range for a person with diabetes] 
- 70-180mg/dl 
options for treatment for Type 2 diabetes 
- exercise [physical activities] 
- healthy diet 
- weight loss 
two types of insulin 
- basal insulin [overnight, between meals] [one unit per hour] 
- bolus insulin [before meals, OR WHEN glucose is high] [dosed manually] [requires a calculator] 
calculator => input: carbs, BG | output: units [insulin units] 

- minimum number of insuline units in pod to function => 85u
- maximum number of insuline units in pod => 200u

types diabetes 
- 90-95% Type 2  
- 5-10 Type 1 [Omnipod]

long term complications of high glucose levels: 
- microvascular disease [kidney and eye disease] 
- acidity in the blood 
- heart disease 
- stroke 
-----  
Hypoglycemia or 'low blood glucose' is medically defined as blood glucose below 70mg/dl  (3.9mmol/L) 

If hypoglycemia is left untreated, it could lead to unconsciousness, seizures or even death.  

mmol/L * (18) = mg/dL 

Hypoglycemia common symptoms: 
shaky. sweaty, dizzy, confusion and difficulty speaking, hungry, weak or tired, headeache, nervous or upset 

in case of hypoglycemia: 
- check BG 
- 15grams of fast acting carbs 
- 15 min interval => check BG 
- administer glucagon 
------
The "Rule of 15" 
- Consume at least 15 grams of fast acting carbohydrates (see examples of carbs to your right) 
- Wait 15 minutes and then recheck BG levels 
- If BG is still less than 70 mg/dL  (3.9mmol/L) or symptoms persist, repeat the Rule of 15 
- If BG is greater than 80 mg/dL (4.4 mmol/L), follow with a snack or meal 
----- 
What could cause hypoglycemia?: 
- Too much insulin or diabetes medications 
- Exercise or physical activity without adjusting medication or food intake 
- Not eating enough carbohydrates for the insulin in the body 
- Timing of insulin/medications
- Alcohol consumption 
-----  
Hyperglycemia is abnormally high levels of glucose (greater than 180mg/dl or 10 mmol/L) in 
the blood. 
It occurs when the body does not produce or have enough insulin to use. Some causes may be not having enough insulin for the amount of carbohydrates consumed, stress, illness, expired insulin or lack of insulin delivery from an insulin pump.  

What can cause hyperglycemia? 
- Not taking enough insulin for glucose needs 
- Illness, stress, or infection that raises glucose levels 
- Certain medications, such as steroids or chemotherapy 
- Using expired insulin 
- Not taking the correct amount of insulin for the food consumed 
- Bad eating habits

I-nsulin pump infusion site that is not working 
------ 
Why is hyperglycemia a concern? 
Long term, high blood glucose, can result in 'microvascular' and 'macrovascular' complications.  
Hyperglycemia can damage the vessels that supply blood to vital organs, which can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke, kidney disease, vision problems, and nerve problems.  
------ 
Hyperglycemia symptoms can include excessive thirst, blurred vision, frequent urination, and increased hunger. 
Long term Hyperglycemia => Ketoacidosis
----- 
Diabetic Ketoacidosis or "DKA" is a life threatening  
condition where the body begins to break down fat for energy in place of glucose. This happens because there is not enough circulating insulin in the body to allow the cells to receive glucose. 
The body will try to compensate by breaking down fat & protein to use for energy. This event produces ketones in the blood, which creates an acidic environment. 
Acidic blood can cause DKA--which can cause a loss of consciousness, swelling in the brain, diabetic coma and even death.

How to Create and Use Temp Basal Presets
-----
Self Monitoring of Blood Glucose
SMBG is ideally the first task that a doctor or nurse may give a person when they are determining the diagnosis of diabetes.  
SMBG only tells you what your current glucose is...NOT the direction it is heading.
-----
CGM is able to monitor the glucose levels every 5 minutes...and it can tell the direction of where the glucose is heading!
-----
Insulin cannot be ingested by mouth. It is  taken by injection(needle), insulin pen or insulin pump.
Insulin pumps use rapid or short-acting insulin. Remember those words and bolus and basal?  Insulin pumps provide a small amount of continuous insulin called the BASAL RATE.
And the user can take a BOLUS of insuline to cover carbs eaten to correct a high blood glucose.
-----
Insulin pumps controls user's glucose. The PUMPS use a 'BOLUS CALCULATOR' to help determine the amount of INSULIN needed.

BASAL => steady flow of insulin

 The calculator in the insulin pump needs to know what glucose levels are acceptable and desired.  The healthcare provider will provide the user with a target range that the Bolus Calculator can use to help recommend the right amount of insulin.  
 The insulin to carbohydrate or IC RATIO specifies how many carbohydrates are covered by one unit of insulin. The user needs to enter the grams of carbohydrates consumed and the Bolus calculator will recommend the amount of insulin to 'cover' the grams of carbohydrates consumed.
 The CORRECTION FACTOR defines how much one unit of insulin will lower the blood glucose (sometimes this is called the Sensitivity Factor--how sensitive are you to 1 unit of insulin?). For example, if the Correction Factor is 50, one unit of insulin will lower the glucose level by 50mg/dl (2.8mmol/L).

bolus calculator -> IC RATIO = grams of carbs / unit of insulin

INSULINE ACTION
The duration of Insulin Action is the length of time that insulin stays active in the body -or how long a bolus of insulin takes to finish lowering the blood glucose. Insulin doesn't work the same for everyone with diabetes, so this setting helps the pump recognize insulin activity in the user.
This setting helps prevent the user from taking  boluses too close together which could cause hypoglycemia.
Insulin Action is set in hours.

INSULINE ON BOARD (IOB)
The IOB helps determine how much insulin is still active inside the body from the previous bolus dose. It uses the Insulin Action time to help determine this.
For example: Insulin Action is set at 4 hours and Victor delivers 4 units of insulin.

        Just after the bolus, there are 4 units of insulin working in his system

        After 1 hour:   3 units of insulin left working in his system - 3 units IOB

        After 2 hours: 2 units of insulin left working in his system - 2 units IOB

        After 3 hours: 1 unit of insulin left working in his system -  1 unit IOB

        After 4 hours: 0 units left - 0 IOB
-----
The insulin pump delivers insulin through the infusion site.  A small 'cannula' is inserted under the skin with a needle 
-----
A closed loop or AID system use a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and a smart algorithm to automatically adjust insulin delivery via the pump.  
The goal of these products is to reduce or eliminate hypoglycemia, improve time in range and reduce hyperglycemia.
-----
Continuous Glucose Monitor -> is NOT INSULINE DELIVERY
-----
An AID system is an insulin pump that communicates with a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and a smart algorithm to automatically adjust insulin delivery.
-----
EVERY 5 minutes glucose level is updated with CGM
-----
CGM -> sends alarms
OMNIPOD 5 => AID
-----
3 parts of CGM system: sensor, transmitter, and app or receiver
trend arrows in CGM system -> informs the direction the glucose is heading
total daily insulin -> amount delivered each day including user boluse and algoriths calculations

1. What are some types of insulin delivery devices?
➢ Expected Answer: needles/syringes, insulin pens, insulin pumps

2. What type of insulin do insulin pumps use?
➢ Expected Answer: rapid or short acting insulin

3. How does an insulin pump deliver insulin? 
➢ Expected Answer: A small amount of continuous insulin—called basal insulin is being
delivered. The user will give additional insulin (bolus) for meals and to correct a high
glucose level.

4. What does CGM stand for?
➢ Expected answer: Continuous Glucose Monitoring (Monitor)

5. How often is the glucose level updated with CGM?
➢ Expected Answer: every 5 minutes

6. What is one value of using a CGM system?
➢ Expected answer: no fingersticks, can tell direction the glucose is heading; alerts and
alarm help user know what is happening

7. What does AID stand for?
➢ Expected answer: Automated Insulin Delivery System

▪ What is the name of Insulet’s AID system?
• Omnipod 5

8. What is an insulin to carb ratio?
➢ Expected answer: the number of grams of carbohydrate that one unit of insulin will
cover ie; a carb ratio or IC ratio of 15 states that 1 unit of insulin will ‘cover’ 15 grams of
carbohydrates; if the customer is eating 30 grams of carbs they would need 2 units of
insulin for those carbs consumed

9. What is a correction factor?
➢ Expected answer: The number that will be lowered in glucose value by 1 unit of insulin
ie; Correction factor of 50 lowers the glucose by 50 points

10. How does an automated insulin delivery system differ from an insulin pump?
➢ Expected answer: The AID system uses an algorithm to help control the delivery of
insulin to keep the user as close to target as possible. It uses the values from the CGM to
complete the algorithm. The basal rate is ‘adaptive’ as the amount of basal changes
based on the glucose levels.

11. What are the part of a CGM system?
➢ Expected answers: the sensor (under the skin) the transmitter which sits on top of
sensor and transmits the data; the App or receiver, the inserter
